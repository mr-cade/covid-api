USER STORY
As a user I want to be able to navigate through the covid-19 statistics for the whole world and I want to be 
able to see the statistics displayed on the map for the United States.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- WHEN the user hover overs the map of the United State.
-THEN the user is able to see the total confirmed cases for that particular state.
 (we should add more acceptance criteria such as  the graphs, enter region . We all can basically add what each of us did)
